# Project Description: Creating a Simple Project Using JavaScript Flavors

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 7 of our **_"Programming Skills"_** bootcamp! In this session, we covered various flavors of JavaScript and their features. We learned about popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks like **_React JS, Angular JS, and TypeScript_**.

## Project Requirements

As part of this session, you are required to create a simple project using one of the JavaScript flavors we covered. Your project should demonstrate your understanding of the selected flavor and its features. You are free to choose any flavor you like.

## Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

* Choose a JavaScript flavor that interests you the most and think about what you can build using it.
* Plan your project and define its scope. Your project should be simple but demonstrate your knowledge of the selected flavor.
* Use the resources provided during the session, including code examples and exercises, to help you build your project.
* You may also refer to external resources, such as online tutorials and documentation, to learn more about the selected flavor and its features.
* Your project should be well-structured and readable. Use proper coding conventions and best practices.
