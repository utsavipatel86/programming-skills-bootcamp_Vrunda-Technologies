# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a software application that is designed to manage a library's catalog. It helps in keeping track of books, their availability, and borrowers. The Library Management System is designed to help librarians to manage their library easily and efficiently.

## Features

The Library Management System provides the following features:

* Add new books to the library catalog
* Remove books from the library catalog
* Update book information (title, author, genre, etc.)
* View the list of all books in the library
* Search for books by title or author
* Borrow a book
* Return a book

## Classes

The Library Management System has the following classes:

### Book

The Book class represents a single book in the library with properties such as title, author, genre, and availability.

### Catalog

The Catalog class contains a list of all books in the library and methods for adding, removing, updating, and searching for books.

### Borrower

The Borrower class represents a person who borrows a book and contains information such as name and borrowed books.

### BorrowedBook

The BorrowedBook class represents a book that has been borrowed and contains information such as the borrower's name and due date.

## Implementation

The Library Management System is implemented in Java and uses fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and variables. Basic data structures such as arrays or lists are used to manage the list of books in the catalog and the list of borrowed books. Control flow statements such as if-else statements and loops are used to implement the search and borrowing features.
